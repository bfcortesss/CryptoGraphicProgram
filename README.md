# CryptoGraphicProgram: Using a Digital Envelope and Keyed Hash MAC

This porject implements a CryptoGraphic approach which applies Encryption and Decryption using a Digital Envelope and a Keyed Hash MAC.

This demonstrates a secure autenticaion system between a **sender X** and **receiver Y**.

**Encryption/Decryptions** through RSA and AES.

**Keyed Hash MAC** for message authentication.

**Digital Envelope** is used for key distribution.
